“Rock paper scissors” is a simple and interesting game. Many of us used to play it in a school to resolve disputes or just to spend some time. But how to play it with computer using gesture?

The rules are very simple and probably you remember them from your childhood:

If you choose the same action, it is a tie.
If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.
If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.
If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.
